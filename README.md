# Current Users
Sealog is in the final stages of being deployed on the human occupied vehicle Alvin operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.

# Thanks and acknowledgments
Sealog is in ongoing development thanks to the generosity of the Schmidt Ocean Institute (SOI) who have support the project since 2018. I also want to thank the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who provided the initial inspiration for the project and are slated to become it's first user.

Lastly I want to thank the UNOLS community who have helped me since the beginning by sharing their wealth of experience and technical ability.
